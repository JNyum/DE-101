## Why I want to be DE
First of all, I realized that development suits me far better than management or economics, which led me to dream of becoming a developer. And let’s be honest—high salaries, remote work, and flexible hours? It’s the ultimate dream job!
The next step was figuring out what kind of developer I wanted to be. I’ve always enjoyed analyzing trends and making predictions based on data—like noticing patterns and saying, “See? It turns out I was right!” That’s why I decided to pursue a career as a data-friendly developer.
Initially, my dream role was a Database Administrator (DBA). However, I’ve recently shifted my focus to becoming a Data Engineer for several reasons. I enjoy the process of gathering and creating something new rather than simply managing what’s already collected. I also wanted to become a versatile developer whose skills can be applied across various fields. And perhaps most importantly, I’ve realized I prefer being the behind-the-scenes supporter rather than the one in the spotlight.
